# SQL Query Exclusion Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries where the '>' operator is used instead of '>='. This leads to the exclusion of values equal to the specified threshold.  The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version. This is a subtle bug that can be easily missed, especially in complex queries.
